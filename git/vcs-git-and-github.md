VCS, Git & GitHub
==================

## Version Control

#### What is VCS?
> Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time.

 <small>https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control</small>

#### Why Version Control?
1. Collaboration
2. Track complete change history
3. Branching and Merging
4. Releases and Versions
5. Revert/Rollback

#### Distributed Version Control Systems
 * Code is hosted in a repository
 * Every client has a complete copy of the repository
 * Synchronize the changes in between client and server
 * Every clone is really a full backup of the repository
 * Example: Git, Mercurial, etc.

## Git

#### What is Git?
Git is a Distributed Version Control System (VCS). More precisely, the most popular and widely used modern version control system used today.

It was originally developed by Linus Torvalds the creator of the Linux kernel.


#### So, what's the big deal about Git?
 * Easy to learn
 * Powerful
 * Performance
 * Flexible
 * Open Source
 * And it's a de facto standard for VCS these days

#### Installation
##### Linux
**Ubuntu/Debain**
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

**Centos/RHEL/Fedora**
```bash
$ sudo yum install git
```

For other distros check the official docs https://git-scm.com/downloads.

##### Windows
1. Download the installer from
   https://git-for-windows.github.io/
2. Install Git

**Note: This tutorial more focuses on CLI usage. If you're a windows user and prefer GUI instead, please go through this instadinstadtutorial: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/git-on-windows-for-newbs--net-25847.**

##### Check Installation
Once installation is completed, veriy git is properly installed on your computer using

```bash
$ git --version
```
It should print the git version installed on your system like this.
```plain
git version 2.7.4
```

#### Configuration

The first thing you do after installing git is to configure your user name and email.
```bash
$ git config --global user.name <name>
$ git config --global user.email <email>
```
Then you can check your config with
```bash
$ git config --list

user.name=YourName
user.email=your_email@example.com
core.editor=vim
core.excludesfile=/home/ubuntu/.gitignore_global
```


#### Setting up a repository

You can use `git init` command to  create a new Git repository.

```bash
# Go to your project directory
$ cd /your/project/directory

# Initialize a git repository
$ git init
```

To clone a remote repository, run `git clone` command. This clones a remote repository into the local machine.

This will create a complete copy of remotely hosted repository in your local computer.
```bash
$ git clone <repo url> [directory]
```

#### Adding files
In order to save your changes to the repository you'll need to `commit` your changes.

You first need to select files you want to commit using this `git add` command.
```bash
# Add specific file(s)
$ git add <file(s)...>

# Add whole path or directory
$ git add <path>

# Add all of your changes
$ git add --all
```

#### Committing changes
The git commit command commits the staged changes to the history.

```
$ git commit
```
<small>This will ask you to enter a commit message for your commit. </small>

<small>In case you don't like to be prompted for the message, you can set directly using the `-m` option like this</small>
```
$ git commit -m "This was my first commit"
```

#### Checking status
We use `git status` command to display the status of the working directory and the staging area.

```bash
$ git status
```
<small>If you have nothing to be committed or no untracked files then it would just show some message like this</small>
```bash
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```
<small>But if you have some changes to be committed it lists them.</small>

#### History
We can use the `git log` command to display the history of committed changes on the repository.

```bash
$ git log
```
<small>There are lots of options available for better inspection of history. For instance,</small>
```bash
$ git log --oneline # Shows each commit on one line
$ git log -n <limit>
$ git log --author="<pattern>"
$ git log <since>..<until>
```

#### Adding a remote
You need to add remote repository urls of a remote server to be able to synhronize your changes with the remote repository.
You can do this using the `git remote add` command.

```bash
$ git remote add <name> <remote url>
```
<small>You can verify added remotes by doing</small>
```bash
$ git remote -v
```
<small>It should list the urls to the remote repositories you've added so far.</small>

#### Pushing your changes

Push all the changes (commits) you did to your local repository to the remote repositories is pretty simple with `git push` command.

```bash
# Push a local branch changes to remote
$ git push <remote> <branch>

# Push all the changes of local branches to remote
$ git push <remote> --all
```
<small>For instance:</small>
```bash
$ git push origin master
```

#### Pulling remote changes
The `git pull` command fetches the changes of the current branch from remote and merges it into the local branch.

This is same as running the combination of `git fetch` and then `git merge`.

```bash
$ git pull <remote> [branch]
```
<small>Example:</small>
```bash
$ git pull origin master
```

#### Checking out
Checking out code actually means to take your working directory to a specific change (commit), branch, tag or or even different versions of files.

You can do all these things with just a simple command `git checkout`.

```bash
$ git checkout <commit>         # go to that commit
$ git checkout <commit> <file>  # checkout that file to previous version
$ git checkout <branch>         # go to another branch
$ git checkout <tag>            # go to a tagged version of the repository
```

#### Branching
The `git branch` command allows you to list, create and delete branches.

To create a new branch you can do
```bash
$ git branch <new-branch-name>
```

#### Merging
You can use `git merge` command to merge changes of a branch into the current `HEAD`.

Merging a branch into your current branch is as simple as:
```bash
$ git merge <branch>
```
