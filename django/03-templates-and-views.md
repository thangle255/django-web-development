Templates and Views
===================

In this tutorial we'll be adding more templates and design improvements on our todo application we built using django in the previous tutorial.

Here we'll be mostly working with the UI of the todoapp using django template tags, html & css to finish our app's looks.

We'll start with the following steps:

1. Create a new url route for "Create TODO" page and link it with the Add button.
2. Extract a base template the app from `index.html`.
3. Add a new template for the create form.
4. Add template for the TODO list.
5. Add actions (Edit/Remove) for each of the TODO item on the list.
6. Display the actions (Edit/Remove) only when the TODO items are hovered.
7. Render the todo list dynamically using a list of todo items.
8. Strike-through and fade the completed items.
9. Add a new url for saving the TODO items.
10. When Add form is saved:
    - Create a new TODO item.
    - Redirect back to the index page.
11. Create a new url for the TODO edit page and display edit page when "Edit" link is clicked.
12. When Edit form is saved:
    - Save the changes made on the edited item.
    - Redirect back to the index page.
