Variables, Types & Operators
============================

## Variables

> A variable is a symbolic name for (or reference to) information. The variable's name represents what information the variable contains.

From http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/variables.html


**For Instance**: `foo` and `bar` could be variables that are just symbolic names that represent some information in the memory.

```python
# Variable foo contains "Some Information"
foo = "Some Information"

# And variable bar contains 15.04
bar = 15.64

# Now variable `foo` can be used to get the reference of that "Some Information"
print("It contains", foo)

# And they could be used in expressions too
print("Result = ", 5 * bar + 2)
```

#### Variables in Python
* Dynamically typed.
* Every variable is an object.
* Names are case sensitive.
* Assigned to a value using `=` operator eg: `foo = 10`.
* Name can contain letters, underscores (`_`) followed by numbers.
* **Naming Convention**: lowercase names using underscore `_` to separate words. eg: `first_name`, `last_name`, etc.

**For instance**
Let's say we have a numeric value `20.0` and we want to store it as the radius of a circle.
We do that like this.
```python
radius = 20.0
```

Here,
 1. `radius` is a variable.
 2. `20.0` is the value assigned to that variable.

Suppose that we need to store another constant value `3.14` as pi.

We can do that as well.
```python
PI = 3.14
```

Now, `PI` is another variable that holds 3.14.

Let's do some computation with these values we have now.
```
# Values we have
radius = 20.0
PI = 3.14

# Compute area of the circle
area = PI * radius * radius

# Print the results
print("Area of Circle =", area)
```

#### In a Nutshell

**A variable is a symbol that stand in for a value in the program.**

#### Example 1
```python
first_name = "Kabir"
last_name = "Baidhya"
home_town = "Kathmandu, Nepal"

print("Hi! I am", first_name, last_name, ".")
print("I'm from", home_town, ".")
```
<small>Output:</small>
```plain
Hi! I am Kabir Baidhya .
I'm from Kathmandu, Nepal .
```

## Data Types

#### Buit-in Data types
* **Numeric**: int, float, long
* **Boolean**: bool
* **Sequences**: str, list, tuple, bytes
* **Mappings**: dict
* **Sets**: set, frozen set

#### Immutable & Mutable types

1. Immutable types
    - <small>int, float, long, str, tuple, frozen set, etc.</small>
2. Mutable types
    - <small>list, dict, set, etc.</small>


#### Integer
Integers are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal points.
In python 2.x there are two `int` types: `int` and `long`.

But in python 3.x onwards both have been unified into `int` and it behaves as `long`.

```python
total_lessons = 24
```

#### Float
They represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point.

```python
percentage = 70.05
```

#### Boolean
Variables with boolean type can represent only two values `True` or `False`.

```python
success = True
failure = not success
```

#### Example 2
```python
an_integer = 6
a_floating_point = 17.60
a_boolean = True
a_string = "Foo"

print("Integer value =", an_integer)
print("Float value =", a_floating_point)
print("Boolean value =", a_boolean)
print("String value =", a_string)
```

<small>Output: </small>
```plain
Integer value = 6
Float value = 17.60
Boolean value = True
String value = Foo
```

## Operators

#### Arithmetic Operators

Python supports all the basic arithmetic operators just like any other programming languages.

|Operator   |  Operation 	| Example	|
|:---------:|---------------|:---------:|
| + 		| Addition    	| a + b 	|
| _ 		| Subtration  	| a - b 	|
| * 		| Multiplication| a * b 	|
| / 		| Division		| a / b 	|
| \**		| Exponentiation| a \** b 	|
| %			| Modulo		| a % b 	|


#### Comparison Operators

Common comparison operators in python are `<`, `>`, `==`, `>=`, `<=`, and `!=`.
All of these operators return boolean results.


|Operator   |  Comparison 					| Example	|
|:---------:|-------------------------------|:---------:|
| &gt; 		| Is greater than				| a &gt; b 	|
| &lt; 		| Is less than					| a &lt; b 	|
| == 		| Is equal to					| a == b 	|
| &gt;= 	| Is greater than or equal to	| a &gt;= b	|
| &lt;=		| Is less than or equal to		| a &lt;= b	|
| !=		| Is not equal to				| a != b 	|


#### Logical Operators

All of these operators return boolean results.


|Operator   |  Operation 				| Example	|
|:---------:|---------------------------|:---------:|
| and 		| Logical AND				| a and b 	|
| or 		| Logical OR				| a or b 	|
| not 		| Logical NOT				| not a 	|


#### Example 3
Try these in the Python shell.

```python
>>> (1 * 4) + (4 / 2) - (3 * 2)
>>> 7 % 3
>>> 2 ** 3
>>> 1 > 2
>>> 1 >= 1
>>> 1 < 5
>>> 1 <= 5
>>> 7 == 5
>>> 8 != 5
>>> 7 > 2 and 5 < 8
>>> 7 > 10 or 5 < 8
>>> not (5 > 7)
```

## User Input
Getting the user input is an important part of every program.
In python you can use the `input` function to get the user input easily.

```python
# Get the input and store it in the variable.
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# Print the entered value.
print("Hi", name)
```
Note: `input` only works in python3. You need to use `raw_input` if you're using python2.

## Exercises

1. Write a program to calculate the diameter, circumference, and the area of circle using the value of `radius` and constant `PI = 3.14159`.
2. Write a program to calculate the distance between two points represented by coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` respectively.

3. Write a program to compute the possible values of `x` from a quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 (a â‰  0) using the quadratic equation formula.

4. Make changes in the program you wrote for exercise 1 to get the radius from the user.
5. Make changes in the program you wrote for exercise 2 to get x1, y1 & x2, y2 from the user.
6. Make changes in the program you wrote for exercise 3 to get the values of a, b & c from the user.
7. Write a program that asks for a number and prints if it's an even number or not.
