Modules and Packages
============================

## Modules
Modules in Python are nothing just plain python files with `.py` extension that may contain and expose a set of definitions be it functions, classes, variables, etc.

Definitions from one module can be imported to other modules and so on which helps in code reusability.

Of course you can think of functions when you want to create reusable logic in your code. But you need some kind of wrapper or namespacing that would wrap your functions and definitions to avoid naming collisions as there could be many functions with the same name. And this is where modules come into play. Modules provide all of these. It provides a wrapper for your functions or any other definitions and plus provide you a namespace. And you can import your functions from one module in other modules pretty easily, taking the code reusability to the next level.

You can use `import` statement to import a module or the definitions from a module in another module.

Consider the following example.

#### Example 1
Create a file `test.py` with the following code:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1

    return n * factorial(n - 1)


def fibo(n):
    result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < n:
        result.append(b)
        a, b = b, a+b

    return result
```

This is simply a python module that contains two functions `factorial` & `fibo`.

Now let's create another module, a main module which we will execute directly. Let's name it `main.py`.

```python
import test # Import the test module here


def main():
    n = int(input('Enter a Number: '))

    series = test.fibo(n)
    print('Fibonacci Series up to {}: \n {}'.format(n, series))
    print('Factorial of {}: {}'.format(n, test.factorial(n)))


main()
```

As simple as that. I think that explains you what modules in python actually are.

## More on Modules
You application generally is composed of several different modules. Modules may contain both executable and non-executable code (like function definitions, class definitions etc.). But it's usually preferable to keep all your executable code only in your main module or the module that you're using as an entry point script and make all the other modules have only non-executable code.

But this might not be the case all the time. Sometimes you may want modules with a combination of both executable and non-executable code.

Or, you may want to conditionally check if the module is run directly as an entry-point script or is imported in other modules to trigger some executable code.

### Module's `__name__`
In every module you define, you can find a `__name__` variable whose value would be the name of the module.
When you run a module directly as a script, the value of `__name__` inside that module is set to `__main__` otherwise it's value would be the module's name.

Look at this example below.

#### Example 2
```python
import sys

def fib(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < n:
        print(b, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
    fib(n)
```

Save this module as `fib.py`:

Now you can use this file both as a script and an importable module.

#### Running it directly
To execute this script directly you can do:

```bash
$ python fib.py 100
```
This would take the value of `n` from the command line arguments and run the program. The code executes and prints the output since here the value of `__name__` will be `__main__`.

#### Importing it on other modules
Now if you're importing the module like this, the executable code under the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block won't be executed. Instead gets executed when the  function `fib` is invoked. Check this:

```python
import fib

n = int(input('Enter N: '))
# Now execute that function.
fib.fib(n)
```

This is because, here the value of `__name__` inside the fib module won't be set to `__main__` again as it was not executed direclty but imported in a different module. So, now the above module which you'll execute directly will have it set as `__main__` instead. And the `fib` module will have the value of `__name__` set to it's name i.e `fib`.

In this way, you may know if the module is run directly as a script or is imported as a module.

## The `import` syntax variants
There are few ways you can use the `import` statement in python.

This is the most basic one which imports the module itself in it's own name.
```python
import fib
```
So, to access the `fib` function defined inside the `fib` module you need to do
```python
>>> fib.fib(50)
```

Another way is to use `from ... import` syntax like this,
```python
from fib import fib
```

This would just import the function `fib` from the module `fib`.
Now to call the `fib` function you can directly do `fib()` instead of doing `fib.fib()` like above.
This would be helpful if you only need one or two functions from a module.

You can import multiple definitions from a module like this:
```python
from foo import bar, baz, test, xyz
```
Here only the names mentioned would be imported.

Lastly, you can also import all the names that a module defines using,
```python
from foo import *
```

This will import everything that has been defined in the `foo` module. But this is not considered a good practice and not recommended either.

## Built-in Modules
Python provides it's standard library as a set of modules and packages too. Let's look into this simple example.

#### Example 3
We'll be using python's built-in `math` module here.

```python
import math

value = 5.34

print('value =', value)
print('ceil =', math.ceil(value))
print('floor =', math.floor(value))
print('abs =', math.fabs(value))
```

Here we're using the [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) module which is one of the built-in modules that python has in it's [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).

Actually there are many built-in modules & packages available out of the box in python's standard library. You can check the full list [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).

## Compiled python modules
Loading python modules does impact the performance a little bit as it's an IO operation. To speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled version of each module. So, when they're imported they usually import the cached or already compiled version of your code instead of the real module. Python 3.x and above stores these compiled byte-code files under `__pycache__` directory and Python 2.x stores them as `.pyc` files just along with the source files.

When you have multiple modules in your application, you will notice these files after you run your program.

## Packages
If you think of the modules as files having `.py` extension; then you can think of packages as directories that contains modules. Packages in python do enable organizing and nesting of modules.

Just the way you used modules to wrap your functions and variables together and expose them to be used in other modules, packages allows you to group your modules and organize them according to your application's need and complexity. You can organize your application using packages, subpackages, modules, submodules and so on.

In python a package is simply just a directory that contains modules (or sub-packages). And most importantly to be a package it must contain a special file `__init__.py` which indicates python that it's a package that contains modules. The `__init__.py` file can be empty too, but it has to be there in the directory.

For instance, consider the following directory structure:

#### Example 4
```
foo/
  __init__.py
  bar
    __init__.py
    baz.py
```

Here `foo` is the main package, `bar` is the sub-package under `foo` and `baz.py` is a module inside `bar`.

Let's say `baz.py` has the following code:
```python
def say_hello(to = 'World'):
    print('Hello', to)
```

Now to reference the `baz` module from outside you would use the `import` statement with dotted names like this:
```python
import foo.bar.baz

# You can call the say_hello() using
foo.bar.baz.say_hello()
```

Alternatively you can use the `import .. from` syntax like this:
```python
form foo.bar.baz import say_hello

say_hello('Again')
```

## Building a simple app
Simple CLI app for maintaining user information. Create a new git repository for this application.

#### User Information App - Phase I
1. Create a package name `app`
2. Create a module `reader` under `app` that exposes a function `read` to read from a file and return it's contents.
3. Create a module `writer` under `app` that exposes a function `write` to write contents to a file.
4. Write a script `user_entry.py` that asks for user's first_name, last_name, email and address and append it in a list of users (list of dictionaries).
5. Allow users to input any number of entries until he chooses to exit.
6. Persist the data as a JSON encoded string into a data file `data.json` at the time of exit.
7. Write a script `user_list.py` that prints reads the data from the file `data.json`, decodes the JSON back and displays the list of users.
8. Make the `user_entry.py` to append the data to the file without overwriting the existing contents.
9. Refactor Code - Create a module `user_store` under `app` with functions `load`, `get_all`, `append`, `save`.
10. Refactor Code - Use `user_store` to replace the logic in the scripts `user_entry.py` and `user_list.py`.
